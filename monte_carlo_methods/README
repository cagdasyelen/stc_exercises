-Type 'make' to generate all the executable files
-Execute them to create dat files for PART I
-Histogram plots are provided under histogram_plots folder
-Type 'make clobber' to clean all executable and dat files


In this assignment, we will do Monte Carlo sampling and its application to integration

---------------------------PART I-1---------------------------------------

In this part, we created a program, rand_uniform.c to generate 100,000 random numbers on [-5,5]
distributed uniformly. Our program generates the random numbers on the given interval and
writes them to a file called rand_uniform.dat. Normalized histogram is plotted by importing
the data file to MATLAB and using histogram function:

histogram(rand_uniform, 'Normalization' , 'pdf')

Histogram plot image is also provided under histogram_plots folder.


---------------------------PART I-2----------------------------------------


In this part, we created a program, rand_exp.c to generate 100,000 random numbers on [0,+inf)
distributed exponentially according to the given function. Our program generates the random
 numbers on [0, 1/3] so that numbers inside the log function is between 0-1. In this way
we generate negative output from the log function and it becomes posititive when it is multiplied
with -3 while using inverse sampling method for the given function. After creating the exponentially
distributed positive random numbers, our program writes them to rand_exp.dat file. Normalized
histogram is plotted by importing the data file to MATLAB and using histogram function:

histogram(rand_exp, 'Normalization' , 'pdf')

Histogram plot image is also provided under histogram_plots folder.


-------------------------------PART I-3-------------------------------------


In this part, we created a program, rand_normal.c to generate 100,000 random numbers on [-5,5]
distributed normally according to the given function. Our program generates the random numbers
on the given interval by using acceptance-rejection method and writes them to a file called 
rand_normal.dat. Normalized histogram is plotted by importing the data file to MATLAB and using 
histogram function:

histogram(rand_normal, 'Normalization' , 'pdf')

Histogram plot image is also provided under histogram_plots folder.


---------------------------PART II-1----------------------------------------


In this part, we created a program, pi.c to estimate pi value by using different number of samples by
using acceptance-rejection method. Program prints the number of samples along with the approximated 
value of pi when it is executed.


---------------------------PART II-2----------------------------------------


In this part, we created a program, integral_unbiased.c to perform integration by using unbiased
sampling. Program prints the number of samples used along with the calculated value of the integral
for the given function for each case. 


---------------------------PART II-3----------------------------------------


In this part, we created a program, integral_importance.c to perform integration by using importance
sampling method by using the distribution function(g(x)) provided. Program prints the number of samples
used along with the calculated value of the integral for the given function for each case.
