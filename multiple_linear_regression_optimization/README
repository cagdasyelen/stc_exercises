In this project, the main purpose is to optimize the number of samples which are used to train
multiple linear regression hypothesis.

The following diagram shows the file/folder structure of the Project

For user to create the executable files, the user needs to enter the /src directory and type
"make". The executable files will be created under /bin directory. The user also can delete all
the executable files and the object files created after compilation by typing "make clobber" 
inside /src directory.

-bin: All executable files are created under this directory

    prog: This program implements the two step optimization(Binary search and second step search)
          and outputs the optimum number of training samples for the dataset.

    plot_all_cost: It iterates through all 506 possible number of training samples and creates
                    all_cost.dat, which includes the cost for 506 different possibilities,
                    under /data directory. Executing this program takes 5~10 mins because it
                    iterates through 1 training samples to 506 different training samples with
                    averaging them 5 times.

    plot_gradient_cost: This program implements the gradient descent method and saves the cost
                        after every iteration so that the user can see how the cost decreases
                        as the gradient descent algorithm runs. Saved cost data for 100000
                        iterations are written to gradient_cost.dat file under /data directory.


-data: It includes the input dataset file, which is data.csv. This file includes 506 different
        samples of housing price data with 13 features like size, location, crime rate, etc.
      all_cost.dat and gradient_cost.dat files are also created under this directory as it is
      mentioned previously.


-dev: This directory includes the python script named txt_to_csv.py. This script converts 
      space seperated data to csv seperated data for our program to use if the dataset file
      is space seperated.



-src: This folder includes all the source files including Makefile.
