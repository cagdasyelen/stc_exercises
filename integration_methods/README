In this assignment, we will approximate the integral as a sum of "areas", where
the are is based upon evaluation of the function and the width based on midpoint rule,
trapezoid rule, and simpson 1/3 rule.

The program calculates the integral of f(x) = x**7 from 0 to 1 by applying methods
stated above and calculates the errors of each method for different approximation
levels.

The ingredients are:

      parameters.h      A header file that contains the prototypes for
                        prog.c file.

      routines.c        A c file contains three different functions for
                        calculating the sum part of the integral for three different
                        methods.

      prog.c            A c file contains the main method. It uses the functions 
                        that we implemented in routines.c and calculates the integral
                        for three different methods and for different levels of N
                        values. Also, it calculates the execution times and the errors 
                        for each method and N values. Finally, it prints all results.

The user will need to type make to create the executable file "integrate" and the object files.
After that the user needs to type "./integrate" to run the program. 

Typing, "make clean" will delete the object files in the directory.

Typing, "make clobber" will delete the object files and the executable file in the directory.
